This tic-tac-toe game can be played with two human  players , or human vs computer player

There is a very simple solution to keeping Tic-tac-toe fresh and interesting, though, and it has been thought up by a group of mathematicians. It’s being called Ultimate Tic-tac-toe and simply embeds a Tic-tac-toe board in each of the nine squares of the original game.

By adding that rule the game is no longer about winning a single board, it’s about tactically managing up to 9 games at once and plotting ahead. You still win by marking three squares in a row, but that now involves winning three games.

BASIC RULES:
1. Each turn, you mark one of the small squares.
2. When you get three in a row on a small board, you’ve won that board.
3. To win the game, you need to win three small boards in a row.
4. You don’t get to pick which of the nine boards to play on. That’s determined by your
opponent’s previous move. Whichever square he picks, that’s the board you must play in next. (And whichever square you pick will determine which board he plays on next.)
